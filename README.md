UMD Power Query for Testduo displays the number of open seats in all sections of INST377. The intention of this project is for students to easily find sections of INST377 with open seats. By utilizing filters, students can pick which section(s) they are interested in and view the number of open seats in that section. In case data is updated on the back-end (umd.io API) users are able to refresh the data. Since data is stored locally, refreshing data will replace locally stored data with new data from a fresh API call. Users can also view the about and quick start guide page to learn how to properly use UMD Power Query for Testudo.
