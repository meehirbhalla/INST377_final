**What is your actual project trying to display and solve?** </br>
UMD Power Query for Testudo displays the number of open seats in all sections of INST377. The intention of this project is for students to easily find sections of INST377 with open seats via a data visualization (bar chart). By utilizing filters, students can pick which section(s) they are interested in and view the number of open seats in that section. In case data is updated on the back-end (umd.io API), users are able to refresh the data. Since data is stored locally, refreshing data will replace locally stored data with new data from a fresh API call. Users can also view the “About” and “Quick Start” guide pages to learn how to properly use UMD Power Query for Testudo.
